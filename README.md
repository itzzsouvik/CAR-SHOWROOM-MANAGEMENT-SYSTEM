# CAR-SHOWROOM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM 🚗

## ✨ Project Overview

The Car Showroom Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage and organize the day-to-day operations of a car showroom. This project is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with a strong focus on inheritance and polymorphism to ensure modularity, reusability, and scalability of the code.

The system consists of three main classes: Showroom, Employee, and Car, which share common behaviors through a common interface. Each class represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its own data and functionality.

The Showroom class manages showroom details such as name, address, total employees, available cars, and manager information.

The Employee class handles employee-related data including employee name, ID, department, and role.

The Car class stores information about cars such as brand, model, price, fuel type, and availability.

Using inheritance, common functionalities are shared across classes, reducing code duplication. Polymorphism is implemented by overriding common methods, allowing the program to call the appropriate behavior at runtime based on the object type.
